# FINDINGS:

### General Acceptance: 
A total of 56.84% of drivers chose to accept the coupon across all categories. When looking at bar coupons alone, the amount of drivers that accepted the coupon was 41%.

### Bar Frequency and Acceptance: 
Drivers who frequent bars more often (more than 3 times a month) have a higher tendency to accept bar coupons. The acceptance rate for drivers who visit bars often is at 76.88% compared to those who visit the bars less frequently (37.07%).

### Age and Acceptance: 
The age of the driver seems to influence the decision as well. Around 69.52% of people over 25, who went to a bar more than once a month, accepted the bar coupon, whereas only 33.50% of the younger age group (below 21 and 21) did.

### Drivers with Passengers and Acceptance: 
Drivers with no kids as passengers and who were not involved in occupations like farming, fishing, or forestry, accepted the bar coupon at a rate of 71.32%. In contrast, the acceptance rate for all other drivers was considerably lower at 29.60%.

### Marital Status, Age, Income, and Acceptance: 
It's clear that circumstances and habits play a role in the decision-making process for drivers. Drivers who frequently visit bars, have no kids as passengers, and are not widowed have an acceptance rate of 68.79%. Younger drivers (under 30) who frequent bars have a higher acceptance rate of 72.17%. Lastly, drivers who frequently eat at less expensive restaurants and have an income less than 50K have an acceptance rate of 59.40% for coupons in general (not just bar coupons).

# HYPOTHESIS:

### Frequency Matters: 
Those who visit bars or other venues more frequently are naturally more inclined to accept coupons that are consistent with habitual patters.

### Age is a Factor: 
Younger drivers, especially those under 30, might be more spontaneous in their decisions and could be more willing to change plans based on such offers.

### Life Circumstances Impact Decisions: 
Marital status (widowed) and having kids seem to influence the decision to visit a bar. This could be due to the responsibilities and priorities associated with these life stages.

### Economic Decisions: 
Drivers with a lower income bracket and who frequent less expensive dining options might be more open to accepting coupons, seeing it as a way to save or have a good time without spending much.

### Occupational Influence: 
The type of occupation that the driver has can influence lifestyle and decisions. For instance, drivers in farming, fishing, or forestry might have different working hours or lifestyle patterns, which could affect their decision to accept a bar coupons.
