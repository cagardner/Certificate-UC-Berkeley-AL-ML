# FINDINGS
## Bar Coupons:
### General Acceptance: A total of 56.84% of respondents chose to accept the coupon across all categories. When considering only bar coupons, this number drops to 41%.

### Bar Frequency and Acceptance: Individuals who frequent bars more often (more than 3 times a month) have a higher tendency to accept bar coupons. The acceptance rate for frequent bar-goers is considerably higher at 76.88% compared to those who visit less frequently (37.07%).

### Age and Acceptance: The age factor seems to influence the decision as well. Around 69.52% of people over 25, who went to a bar more than once a month, accepted the bar coupon, whereas only 33.50% of the younger age group (below 21 and 21) did.

### Occupation and Acceptance: There seems to be a notable occupation-based difference. Bar-goers who had no kids as passengers and who were not involved in occupations like farming, fishing, or forestry, accepted the bar coupon at a rate of 71.32%. In contrast, the acceptance rate for all other drivers was considerably lower at 29.60%.

### Marital Status, Age, Income, and Acceptance: It's evident that personal circumstances and habits play a role in the decision-making process. People who frequent bars, have no kids as passengers, and are not widowed have an acceptance rate of 68.79%. Younger individuals (under 30) who frequent bars have a higher acceptance rate of 72.17%. Furthermore, individuals who frequently eat at less expensive restaurants and have an income less than 50K have an acceptance rate of 59.40% for coupons in general (not just bar coupons).Frequency Matters: Those who visit bars or similar venues more frequently are naturally more inclined to accept such offers. This could be due to their habitual nature of visiting such places or seeing value in such offers.

### Age is a Factor: Younger individuals, especially those under 30, might be more spontaneous in their decisions and could be more willing to change plans based on such offers. They might also be more tech-savvy and open to mobile coupon offers.

### Life Circumstances Impact Decisions: Marital status (widowed) and having kids seem to influence the decision to visit a bar. This could be due to the responsibilities and priorities associated with these life stages.

### Economic Decisions: Individuals with a lower income bracket and who frequent less expensive dining options might be more open to accepting coupons, seeing it as a way to save or have a good time without spending much.

### Occupational Influence: The type of occupation could influence lifestyle and decisions. For instance, those in farming, fishing, or forestry might have different working hours or lifestyle patterns, which could affect their decision to accept a bar coupon.
